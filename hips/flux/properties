obs_description      = H.E.S.S. is an array of ground-based gamma-ray telescopes located in Namibia. The H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS) is the first deep and wide survey of the Milky Way in TeV gamma-rays. The flux values are given as integral photon flux above 1 TeV assuming a power law spectrum for the differential flux with an index of -2.3. The pixel values represent integrated values within a circular region of 0.1 deg.
